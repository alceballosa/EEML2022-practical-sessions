## Dynamics modelling using MPNNs
**Authors:** Iulia Duță and Cătălina Cangea

**Abstract:** This tutorial covers basic concepts from the field of Graph Representation Learning, such as:

* representing a graph structure in an ML setup;
* implementing Graph Neural Network (GNN) variants: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN);
* learning to infer the structure of a graph.

**Outline of the tutorial:**

- Create a dataset to simulate the movement of a set of particles.
- Show how to represent graphs in memory.
- Implement a GNN to predict the trajectories of the particles, given the ground-truth graph connectivity (i.e. the edges of the graph).
- Implement a GNN to predict these trajectories, this time assuming the graph is fully-connected (i.e. each node links to all others).
- Learn to predict the connectivity using an encoder similar to the one used in the NRI (Neural Relational Inference) model.
